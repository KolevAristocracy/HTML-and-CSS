                        I hope this finds you well! Narnia is even more magical than I imagined. The landscapes are
                        breathtaking, and I've met the most fascinating creatures, including Aslan himself. Every day
                        here
                        is an
                        adventure. I visited Cair Paravel and was awed by its beauty. I wish you could see it with me!
                        Sending
                        you
                        lots of love and a touch of Narnian magic. Can't wait to share my stories when I return.
