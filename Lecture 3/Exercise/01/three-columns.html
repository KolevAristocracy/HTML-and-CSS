                Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who

                sought to create an ethical system for
                humans and robots.

                    A robot may not injure a human being or,

                    A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings

                    A robot must protect its own existence as long as
                    such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law

                Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that superseded the others. It
                stated that “a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.”
